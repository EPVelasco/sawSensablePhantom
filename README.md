# sawSensablePhantom

This SAW component contains code for interfacing with the Sensable Phantom Omni.  It compiles on Windows and Linux.  It has been tested with:
  * Linux Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04 and Windows
  * Sensable Phantom Omni 1394 but it might work with other haptic devices from Sensable or 3DS (assuming the C API is the same)

The `ros` folder contains code for a ROS node that interfaces with the sawSensablePhantom component and publishes the 3D transformations, joint positions and efforts, buttons...  It also has subscribers to control the Omni (i.e. set cartesian wrench).  To build the ROS node, make sure you use `catkin build`.

# Running the examples
 
## Linux installation

The first thing to do is to install the drivers.  The vendor's version is rather old and incompatible with most recent Linux distributions.  You can find plenty of how-tos online to patch the driver installation but these tend to be incomplete.  So we created a nifty little script to do the work:  https://github.com/jhu-cisst-external/phantom-omni-1394-drivers
 
The Phantom Omni uses a FireWire port to communicate.  When connecting your tracker to your computer, a pseudo device will be added to the `/dev` directory. Â  Usually something like `/dev/fw1`, `/dev/fw2` or higher.  Using the command `dmesg -w` can help identify which device is used.  First start `dmesg -w` in a terminal, then plug your device.  You should see something like: 
```
[33217.952060] firewire_core 0000:04:00.0: phy config: new root=ffc1, gap_count=5
[33224.507217] firewire_core 0000:04:00.0: phy config: new root=ffc1, gap_count=5
[33224.691773] firewire_core 0000:04:00.0: created device fw1: GUID 000b990082b6980c, S400
```
Check the file permissions on said device, e.g.,
```sh
crw------- 1 root root    243, 0 Mar 22 14:10 /dev/fw0
crw-rw---- 1 root plugdev 243, 1 Mar 23 18:19 /dev/fw1
```
By default the drivers are configured so the OS sets the ownership of `/dev/fw1` to `root` and the group to `plugdev`.   To grant permissions to read and write to the device, use the command `sudo adduser <user_id> plugdev` to add users to the `plugdev` group.   Please note that the user has to logout/login for the new group membership to take effect.

## Configuration

It is important to first run the Sensable provided configuration tool to make sure your device is properly detected and to name it (names are important if you have more than one Omni on the same computer).   To do so, you will have to run the `PHANToMConfiguration` program with admin privileges:
```sh
sudo PHANToMConfiguration
```
In the application, select the *PHANToM Model*.  You should see a serial number appear on the bottom right if everything is working fine.  Click *Add...* and then give your device a name (e.g. "left").  Don't forget to *Apply* before quitting using *Ok*.

In theory, one should be able to have multiple Phantom Omnis on a single computer but so far we were not able to do this on Linux.   If you do figure out a solution, please let us know.   As a stop gap solution, one can use ROS as middleware and 2 computers, one for each Omni. 

## Compilation

This code is part of the cisst-SAW libraries and components.  Once the drivers are installed, you can follow the *cisst-SAW* compilation instructions: https://github.com/jhu-cisst/cisst/wiki/Compiling-cisst-and-SAW-with-CMake.

For Linux users, we strongly recommend to compile with ROS and the python catkin build tools (i.e. `catkin build`, NOT `catkin_make`).  Detailled instructions can be found on https://github.com/jhu-cisst/cisst/wiki/Compiling-cisst-and-SAW-with-CMake#13-building-using-catkin-build-tools-for-ros.

Short version for Ubuntu (18.04) ROS (melodic) to compile using `catkin` and `wstool`:
```sh
sudo apt install libxml2-dev libraw1394-dev libncurses5-dev qtcreator swig sox espeak cmake-curses-gui cmake-qt-gui git subversion gfortran libcppunit-dev libqt5xmlpatterns5-dev # most system dependencies we need
sudo apt install python-wstool python-catkin-tools # catkin and wstool for ROS build
source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash # or use whatever version of ROS is installed!
mkdir ~/catkin_ws # create the catkin workspace
cd ~/catkin_ws # go in the workspace
wstool init src # we're going to use wstool to pull all the code from github
catkin init
cd src # go in source directory to pull code
wstool merge https://github.com/jhu-saw/sawSensablePhantom/raw/devel/ros/sensable_phantom.rosinstall
wstool up # now wstool knows which repositories to pull, let's get the code
catkin build # ... and finally compile everything
```

## Main example

The main example provided is `sawSensablePhantomQtExample`.  The command line options are:
```sh
sawSensablePhantomQtExample:
 -j <value>, --json-config <value> : json configuration file (optional)
 -m, --component-manager : JSON files to configure component manager (optional)
 -D, --dark-mode : replaces the default Qt palette with darker colors (optional)
```

To use the default Omni or only Omni on your computer:
```sh
sawSensablePhantomQtExample -D
```

If you want to use a specific Omni or define your own name for the device (e.g. Left vs Right):
```sh
sawSensablePhantomQtExample -D -j sawSensablePhantomLeft.json
```

Some examples of configuration files can be found in the `share` directory.  Here is an example:
```json
{
    "devices":
    [
        {
            "name": "left"
        }
    ]
}
```

## ROS

The ROS node is `sensable_phantom` and can be found in the package `sensable_phantom_ros`.  If you only have one Omni and don't need a configuration file:
```
rosrun sensable_phantom_ros sensable_phantom
```

If you have more than one Omni, please read the section above for the configuration file description.
```sh
roscd sensable_phantom_config
rosrun sensable_phantom_ros sensable_phantom -D -j sawSensablePhantomLeft.json 
```

The ROS node has one more command line option:
```sh
 -j <value>, --json-config <value> : json configuration file (required)
 -p <value>, --ros-period <value> : period in seconds to read all tool positions (default 0.002, 2 ms, 500Hz).  There is no point to have a period higher than the device (optional)
 -m, --component-manager : JSON files to configure component manager (optional)
 -D, --dark-mode : replaces the default Qt palette with darker colors (optional)
```

Once the node is started AND connected, the following ROS topics should appear:
```sh
/left/button1
/left/button2
/left/measured_cp
/left/measured_cv
/left/measured_js
/left/operating_state
/left/servo_cf
/left/state_command
/stats/events/period_statistics
/stats/left/period_statistics
/stats/publishers_left/period_statistics
/stats/subscribers/period_statistics
```

After you've started the `sensable_phantom` node, you can also visualize the Omni in RViz using:
```sh
roslaunch sensable_phantom_ros rviz.launch
```

Note: urdf and models provided in this repository are from https://github.com/fsuarez6/phantom_omni

## OpenIGTLink (aka `igtl`)

One can also communicate with the Omni using OpenIGTLink as
"middleware" instead of ROS.  To do so, you first need to make sure
sawOpenIGTLink is compiled against OpenIGTLink version 3+ (see https://github.com/jhu-saw/sawOpenIGTLink).  Once sawOpenIGTLink is
compiled, you will need two extra configuration files (examples can be found in `share` directory):
* Component manager configuration file to load the dynamic library `sawOpenIGTLink` and create/configure the OpenIGTLink bridge.  The cisst component manager creates an instance of the class `mtsIGTLCRTKBridge`.  The component manager configuration file is passed to the main program using the option `-m`.
* IGTL bridge configuration file.  This indicates which component and interface to bridge to IGTL.  The component name is set in the `main()` function and should be `SensableHD`.  The interface name is the Omni name you've set when configuring your Omni (default is `Default PHANToM`).
